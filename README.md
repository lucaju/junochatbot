# Juno Chatbot

Juno Chatbot & Storytelling is a research and development project on the use of chatbots for audiovisual storytelling. The project consists in making operational a device for the creation of conversational agents (chatbots) in audiovisual stories. Through the proposed device, users will have the opportunity to develop a conversational agent and thus learn about automatic natural language processing techniques, story creation techniques and tools for the development of conversational agents.

## AI in an educational context

This project is based on innovative approaches in education to contribute to the development of a technological and scientific culture among young people and to include society in the debates around the premises and choices concerning the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Understanding the development of chatbots will better equip young people to understand, debate, and to get involved in decision-making related to AI.
